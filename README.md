# TO_DO_LIST_CLI_TOOL

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively by adding, viewing, completing, and deleting tasks, all while saving the task list to a JSON file for persistence.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks along with their completion status.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Mark specific tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in a `tasks.json` file to maintain data between sessions.

## How It Works

1. The application stores tasks in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).
2. Tasks are represented as dictionaries with two fields:
   - `task`: The description of the task.
   - `completed`: A boolean indicating whether the task is completed.
3. The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## File Structure

- `tasks.json`: A JSON file where tasks are stored persistently.
- The script includes the following functions:
  - **`load_tasks()`**: Loads tasks from the JSON file.
  - **`save_tasks(tasks)`**: Saves the tasks to the JSON file.
  - **`add_task(tasks, task)`**: Adds a new task to the task list.
  - **`view_tasks(tasks)`**: Displays the list of tasks and their statuses.
  - **`mark_task_completed(tasks, task_number)`**: Marks a specific task as completed.
  - **`delete_task(tasks, task_number)`**: Deletes a task from the list.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python to_do_list.py
   ```
2. Use the menu to interact with the application:
   - **Option 1**: Add a new task.
   - **Option 2**: View all tasks.
   - **Option 3**: Mark a task as completed.
   - **Option 4**: Delete a task.
   - **Option 5**: Exit the application.
